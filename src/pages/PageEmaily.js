          Developed a game for Industry clientâ€™s users to learn about team
          dynamics and workplace culture. Worked with other team members to
          implement a fully self-contained and operational video game after
          researching and learning Unity. Developed a web incapsulement for the
          game to be played in browser and other devices using ASP.NET Core
          backend and React frontend.
